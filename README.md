# udacity-capstone-sparkify

### Motivation and Summary of Results
This repository contains the capstone project of udacity data scientist nano degree,  ML implementation by using Spark. 
The main goal of the project was predicting user churn by building a ML pipeline by using PySpark. I have used 3 different classification methods;

- Logistic RegressionÂ 
- Gradient Boosted Tree
- Random Forest Classifier

Even though the F1 scores of 3 model did not differ drastically,  I could predict the user churn best with Logistic Regression with  0.653 F1-score.
The Gradient Boosted model delivered an F1-score of 0.60 where Random Forest Classifier gave 0.64 on the same validation data.

The project is developed on Udacity Spark workspace by using Pyspark and Python.
